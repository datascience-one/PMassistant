# AI Project Management Assistant

## Project Objective
An integrated AI-powered system that automates project management tasks, from initial requirement gathering to task assignment, scheduling, and communication. This project uses multiple LLM-powered agents to break down requirements, schedule tasks, and send communications to team members.

## Current stage

- **Data Backend Integration**: Supports Excel (default), SQL, Odoo ERP, and CSV files for managing tasks and employees.
- **Frontend Dashboard**: A React/Tailwind frontend built with Vite for viewing project status.
- **FastAPI Backend Server**: Exposes various endpoints for agent operations and project queries.
- **Telegram Integration**: System-level alerts and employee registration invites flow via a Telegram bot.
- **Agent Ecosystem**:
  - **Product Manager Agent**: Automatically translates high-level problem statements into full Product Requirement Documents (PRDs).
  - **Task Decomposition Agent**: Breaks down PRDs into granular, actionable tasks with associated roles, budgets, and times.
  - **Resource Agent**: Evaluates tasks and employee profiles to intelligently assign the most suitable available team members to specific tasks.
  - **Resource Validation Agent**: Validates the assigned resources against task constraints, verifying feasibility and optimal allocation.
  - **Scheduler Agent**: Maps structured tasks to real calendar dates, factoring in working hours, weekends, and project start dates.
  - **Communication Agent**: Automates dispatching of assignment emails to employees and CCs the project managers using SMTP.

## Core Scripts Overview

- **`telegram_bot.py`**: The main Telegram integration script that handles interactive bot commands, user authentication, and system alerts.
- **`send_telegram_invite_to_all.py`**: A utility script used to broadcast onboarding registration invites to all employees in the system who haven't registered yet.
- **`start_registration_listener.py`**: A background job that listens for and coordinates new employee registrations from Telegram, finalizing their setup.
- **`sync_meetings.py`**: Synchronizes calendar events and meetings with the database so Agents can schedule around existing obligations.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Node.js 18+**

## Configuration & Environment Variables

You must provide various API keys and credentials to run this project. Please copy the provided `.env.example` to a new file named `.env` in the root directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### How to Obtain Required Credentials (`.env`)

Below is a step-by-step guide on how to acquire the necessary API keys and credentials for the `.env` file:

#### 1. Google Gemini API Key (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`)
- Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
- Click on **Create API key** to generate a new key for your project.
- Copy the key and paste it as the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in your `.env`.

#### 2. Email Credentials (`SENDER_EMAIL` & `SENDER_PASSWORD`)
The Communication Agent uses SMTP to mail tasks to employees. If using Gmail:
- Go to your Google Account -> **Security**.
- Ensure that **2-Step Verification** is turned on.
- Search for **App passwords** in the settings search bar.
- Generate a new App Password (select "Mail" or "Other").
- Paste your Gmail address as `SENDER_EMAIL` and the generated 16-character password as `SENDER_PASSWORD`.

#### 3. Telegram Credentials (`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` & `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`)
The Telegram bot handles employee invites and PM system alerts.
- **To get the Bot Token**: Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`. Message it `/newbot` and follow the prompts. Once created, BotFather will give you an API Token. Paste this as `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
- **To get the Chat ID**: Search for `@userinfobot` or `@getidsbot` on Telegram and send a `/start` message. The bot will reply with your personal Chat ID (e.g., `123456789`). Paste this as `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. If using a group, add the bot to the group and fetch the group chat ID.

*(Additional configurations, such as model selection, working hours, database backend settings, are available in `config.yaml`)*.

## How to Run

You will need to start both the Python backend and the React frontend.

### 1. Backend Setup

Open a terminal in the root directory:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run the FastAPI server
python api_server.py
```

*The backend API will run, typically listening on `http://127.0.0.1:8000` or the port specified.*

### 2. Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal window in the frontend directory:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the frontend UI
cd frontend/

# 2. Install Javascript dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the Vite development server
npm run dev
```

*The frontend UI will be available at the local address printed in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).*

## Todo

We are constantly expanding the capabilities of the agent ecosystem. Here are the features planned for the future:

- [ ] **Reporting Agent**: Generate automatic daily/weekly status reports on project progress.
- [ ] **Risk Management Agent**: Proactively identify and surface potential bottlenecks, delays, or budget overruns.
- [ ] **Resource Optimization**: Dynamic re-allocation of team members based on bandwidth.
- [ ] **Slack/Teams Integration**: Multi-channel notification support beyond Telegram and Email.
